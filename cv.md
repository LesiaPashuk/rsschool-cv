##  ‧₊˚✧About Me✧˚₊‧
Hi!\
I have completed my first year at the Faculty of Applied Mathematics and Computer Science at BSU (Minsk, Belarus). I am particularly interested in frontend development, and I am actively developing my skills in this area using various resources. I have excellent communication skills and the ability to find compromises, which helps me in teamwork. I am eager to keep learning and developing new skills to become a professional in IT.
