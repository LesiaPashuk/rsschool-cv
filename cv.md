##  ‧₊˚✧About Me✧˚₊‧
Hi!\
I have completed my first year at the Faculty of Applied Mathematics and Computer Science at BSU (Minsk, Belarus). I am particularly interested in frontend development, and I am actively developing my skills in this area using various resources. I have excellent communication skills and the ability to find compromises, which helps me in teamwork. I am eager to keep learning and developing new skills to become a professional in IT.

## Skills 
* HTML, CSS
* JavaScript
* Git, GitHub
* VS Code
* Object Oriented Programming (basic knowledge)

## Code example

*Write an algorithm that takes an array and moves all of the zeros to the end, preserving the order of the other elements.*

```function moveZeros(arr) {
 let arrAnser=[];
    let count =0;
    for (let i=0; i<arr.length; i++){
        if(arr[i]!==0){
            arrAnser.push(arr[i]);
            
        }
        else{
            count++;
        }
    }
    while(count>0){
        arrAnser.push(0);
        count--;
    }
    return arrAnser;
}
```
